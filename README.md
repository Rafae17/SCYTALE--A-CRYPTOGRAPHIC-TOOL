# SCYTALE-A-CRYPTOGRAPHIC-TOOL
Scytale originated from ancient Greece and it was a tool that was a major part of the Spartan military's communication system.
Scytale helps to create messages that can be secured from prying eyes.
Now the tool that I created does the same using Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt messages.
This tool was created using python 
This is a creative way to share secret messages to people. But one thing to note is that Caesar Cipher is not so secure. With only 25 possible keys, it is easy to crack. 
So, this can't be used in environments where high security communication with strong encryption is necessary. 
Nonetheless, It's a fun way to send secret messages to people.
